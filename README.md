I also enjoy programming in Java, however currently learning C++ and python for AI and machine learning, and non OOP languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP ect.
I work hard, and dedicate my studies in networking and consantly improving myself.

I am individual who loves technology and aspire to continue to learn because of technology is constantly changing and that is my motivation to learn. However, with a change of pace and a different career path, I want to work where I keep moving physically, mentally, career path and developing skills especially in the field where its constantly changing.
I am internet advocacy, I love the internet and the fundamentals, however I want to study more into the fundamental side and the practical side, along side networking understanding how it works. I want to gain some experience in the IT field, I want to learn while at work. In the near future I may consider getting CCNA if I'm ready and able to afford it.
